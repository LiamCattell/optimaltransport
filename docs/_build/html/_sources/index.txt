Welcome to optimaltransport's documentation!
============================================

This package provides implementations for many optimal transport methods developed and published by the `Imaging and Data Science Lab <http://imagedatascience.com/>`_, led by Prof. Gustavo K. Rohde.
It also provides implementations for many common methods found in the lab's papers, such as penalized linear discriminant analysis (PLDA).

The aim of this package is to make optimal transport transforms available to a wide range of researchers. If you're unsure how optimal transport methods can be useful in signal and image analysis problems, we recommend looking through the `teaching material from the ISBI 2018 conference tutorial <http://imagedatascience.com/transport/tutorials_isbi18.html`_ on optimal transport in biomedical imaging. For more information about the Imaging and Data Science Lab, as well as a list of publications, see the `lab website <http://imagedatascience.com/>`_.
